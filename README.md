# notepadpp_VHDL_PLUGIN
VHDL Plugin for the Notepad++ Editor(64bit)

This code is based on http://sourceforge.net/projects/nppvhdlplugin/ sources and https://sourceforge.net/projects/nppvhdl/ ideas.
The first one has only 4 commands and is case sensitive and the second one works only on npp 32bit versions. I've got the available source code and ideas from the mentioned links and created a new VHDL Assistant Plugin for notepad++ 64 bit.
I'm working on this project and this is the first release.

Important:
For using this plugin, Import dll file from notepad++ Setting-->Import-->Import Plugin(s) menue. You should copy the 4 testbench templates(*.vhd files) and the header template(*.txt file) to the plugins folder of notepad++(for me this is in C:\Program Files\npp.7.8.bin.x64\plugins).

You may modify header template and test bench templates for your applications. Please note that there is two lines in header template file that must be unchanged. I will create a manual on how to modify these templates.
